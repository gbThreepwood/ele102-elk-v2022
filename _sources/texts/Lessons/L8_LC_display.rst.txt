A Liquid crystal display (LCD) [#f1]_ is a form of flat panel display where liquid crystals are used to modulate light in order to change the appearance of the display.

Some displays are application specific, and only support displaying certain patterns (e.g. only numbers, or only text). Others consists of a matrix of pixels, where each individual pixel is controlled independently, either on/off, in different shades, or even in color.

Operation of the Hitachi HD44780 display controller
====================================================

The Hitachi HD44780 is a display controller for character displays, which includes support for ASCII, Japanese, and some additional symbols :cite:`hitachiHD44780Datasheet1998`. Many LC-displays, and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) controllers are compatible with the HD44780.

For simple display applications where one only needs to display text, this kind of display is a popular option. The display is available from multiple manufactures, and with varying size. I.e. with variation in the number of character which can be displayed.


Electrical interface
--------------------

The electrical interface to the HD44780 compatible LC-display consists of several digital control signals, 4 or 8 wires with data, and a clock signal.

- RS - Register select. Select between the data, and the command registers. When RS is low we are in command mode.
- R/W - Read/write. Selects between reading and writing to the LCD controller. Reading is often not used, and the pin is simply tied low (to ground) for write mode.
- EN - Enable. The enable signal is the clock signal where the controller asserts the state of the data inputs.
- Bit 0 to Bin 7 is the data input pins. In 4 bit mode only bit 4 to bit 7 is in use.

Communication protocols
-----------------------

The communication protocol for the HD44780 compatible LC-display is relatively simple, and uses dedicated wires for switching between read and write mode, as well as for switching between command and data mode.



Arduino control of Hitachi HD44780 compatible display
======================================================


.. .. note:: Even though the library is official, you may still have to install it. The steps for installation will wary depending on which platform you are using (PlatformIO, or official Arduino IDE).

Arduino comes with a official HD44780 library, but there are several more capable libraries available. In this lesson we will be using the LiquidCrystal library by *F Malpartida*, which is compatible with the original Arduino LiquidCrystal library but faster and with more features.

.. figure:: ../../fig/screenshots/platformio-liquid-crystal-library.png
  :alt: LiquidCrystal library installation.
  :align: center

Once the library is installed the following code will create a instance of the `LiquidCrystal` object called `lcd`. We will be using the `lcd` instance in the examples to follow.

.. code-block:: c

    const uint8_t rs = 2, en = 3, d4 = 4, d5 = 5, d6 = 6, d7 = 7;
    LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);

Some of the LCD library methods we will be using in this lesson include:

- `lcd.begin() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalBegin>`_
- `lcd.write() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalWrite>`_
- `lcd.print() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalPrint>`_
- `lcd.setCursor() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LiquidCrystalSetCursor>`_
- `lcd.clear() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalClear>`_

- `lcd.scrollDisplayLeft() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalScrollDisplayLeft>`_
- `lcd.scrollDisplayRight() <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalScrollDisplayRight>`_

In the following examples we will be using this circuit:

    :align: center

Electrical test
---------------

Adjust the resistance of the potmeter until black squares are clearly visible on the top row of the LC-display. The bottom row should remain blank. Try to exceed the optimum value and observe that black squares appear in both rows, but make sure to only have squares in one row before you proceed with the firmware tests. 

The backlight of the LC-display should be illuminated.

Software test
----------------

In order to verify the operation of our LC-display, a very simple firmware will be used for the initial test.


.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/platformio/lc-display/hello-lc-display/src/main.cpp
    :language: c


The first two lines of interest provides meaningful names to some pin numbers, and instantiate the :ccode:`LiquidCrystal` object:

.. code-block:: c

    const uint8_t rs = 2, en = 3, d4 = 4, d5 = 5, d6 = 6, d7 = 7;
    LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);

Further down in the :ccode:`setup()` function, the LCD driver is initialized and configured for a 16x2 character display by the method :ccode:`lcd.begin(16, 2);`. Finally the method :ccode:`lcd.print("Hello, world!");` prints the text "Hello, world!" to the display. The cursor is automatically advanced as each character is transferred to the display.

Exercises and examples
======================

This section contains examples on how to use the LC-display, and various exercises which allows you to practice the use of the display.

Display uptime in seconds on UART and LCD
------------------------------------------

In the following example the current uptime in seconds is displayed on the LCD, as well as on the UART. There is one important difference to note between the two, as the cursor on the LCD is moved back with the :ccode:`setCursor()` method, while the cursor in your serial terminal is always moving forward. As you can probably realize a set cursor method for your serial monitor would be a useful addition in many cases. This is unfortunately not supported by the basic serial monitors in the Arduino IDE, or PlatformIO. It is possible to use more advanced serial monitors which supports this, but it will not be discussed in this lesson.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/lc_display_uptime/src/main.cpp
    :language: c

It should be noted that since the :ccode:`setCursor()` method only move the cursor without deleting the text on the display, it is possible that some old and irrelevant text remains in the display after you try to print some new value. For the uptime example in this section it will not be a problem since the uptime is always increasing, but consider the case where you sometimes would print a number with fewer digits than the previous number. Some of the digits in the old number would remain in the display, and the reading would thus be incorrect. There are several possible solutions to this problem, one of which is to simply clear the display before printing some new value. This is achieved by calling the method :ccode:`lcd.clear();` This is demonstrated in the next section.


Display voltage value from potmeter
------------------------------------

In this example we will read a analog value from a potmeter connected to `A0`. The raw value, as well as the corresponding voltage level will be displayed on the LCD, as well as on the UART.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/lc_display_potmeter_value/src/main.cpp
    :language: c


Exercise: thermometer
----------------------


In this exercise you will develop a thermometer which displays the temperature on a LC-display, as well as on the UART. You will use the `TMP36 <https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/TMP35_36_37.pdf>`_ sensor which is included in the Arduino kit.

The following wiring of the LC-display and thermometer can be used. Here the LC-display is rotated 180 degrees with respect to the previous examples. This makes the orientation of the display correct with respect to the orientatin of the Arduino, but also makes the wiring more cumbersome.

.. figure:: ../../fig/fritzing/arduino_lc-display-thermometer_bb.png
    :scale: 50
    :align: center


#. Write the code required to read the temperature once every second and print the value to the UART. Use :ccode:`millis()` instead of :ccode:`delay()`.
#. Add the code required to print the temperature on the LC-display.
#. Cooperate with one of your classmates, and wire up two temperature sensors to the same Arduino UNO. Print the value of both sensors simultaneously to the LC-display. One of the sensors could be used for measuring the outside temperature, while the other measures the inside temperature (as in a classical electrical temperature sensor for your home).
#. The temperature sensors in the Arduino kit (TMP36) are not very accurate. The datasheet states a +/- 2 degree accuracy over the specified temperature range. If this inaccuracy has a normal distribution, higher accuracy could be obtained by averaging the temperature reading over multiple samples. Write the code required to take the average over 20 samples.
 
..   #. **Optionally:** add a cable to one of your temperature sensors so it can be placed outside, while the other sensor remains inside.
     #. **Optionally:** add a Matlab/Python/C# program to your PC which receives the data from the UART on your temperature sensing Arduino, and write the received data to a file. Create a graph of the temperature variation over time. Try to have the program running for a few days, monitoring the temperature inside, and outside of your apartment.


Splash screen and scrolling text
--------------------------------
Although splash screens can be anoying, and should be used sparingly, they will be used here to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the LC-display.

If you have more text to display than is available on the screen, one option is to use scrolling. Without any user input, you will have to implement automatic scrolling. You will often see this done in simple LC-displays used in various information screens.


.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/lc_display_text_scroll/src/main.cpp
    :language: c


Display data from UART
----------------------

In this simple example we will take input from the serial terminal (UART), and print it on the LC-display. The LC-display will print both the character (if supported) and the actual binary data that is received (printed in decimal form).

.. note:: You should try to send special characters, such as æ, ø, and å and see how the display responds.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/lc_display_uart_data/src/main.cpp
    :language: c

Display data in different formats
---------------------------------

In the following examples we will be using this circuit:

.. figure:: ../../fig/lc_display_potmeter_value_bb.png
    :scale: 50
    :align: center


In this example we will display the raw value of the analog reading on `A0`. The push button on pin `13` will toggle through various number bases for the display.


.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/lc_display_analog_different_bases/src/main.cpp
    :language: c

Voltmeter with selectable scaling
---------------------------------

The following example shows how to implement a simple state machine which allows the user to select the scaling prefix of the measured voltage.

The following state diagram depicts the operation of the prefix display toggle functionality. 

.. uml::

        [*] --> MILLIVOLT

        MILLIVOLT -down-> KILOVOLT : toggle_button
        KILOVOLT -down-> VOLT : toggle_button
        VOLT -> MILLIVOLT : toggle_button

The following source code implements the state machine, as well as the additional functionallity that is required:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/lc_display_voltmeter/src/main.cpp
    :language: c 


Adding custom character to the display
--------------------------------------

A HD44780 compatible display is capable of storing up to 8 custom characters. These characters are stored in a volatile memory, and must be transferred to the LC-display after each power cycle. The characters will be accessible like any normal character, on the addresses 0x00 to 0x07. If you look carefully on the LC-display, you may observe that each character is printed in a rectangle which is 5 pixels wide, and 8 pixel tall. We have :math:`5 \cdot 8 = 40` pixels. Each custom character uses 8 bytes of memory, where each byte stores one row of 5 pixels. The bits 0 to 4 in each byte are used to set the respective pixels high or low, while the bits 5 - 7 are not used.

The following code demonstrates how to use the LiquidCrystal library for defining of custom characters. In the example several battery icon characters are defined, which could be useful to indicate the battery status of some battery powered device.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../projects/platformio/lc-display/custom-character-lc-display/src/main.cpp
    :language: c
    :linenos:

You will sometimes see creative combination of multiple pixel blocks in order to create more spectacular characters (or simple drawings). Since the character memory can be updated while the display is running, the 8 custom character limitation can be overcome by having more character defined in the microcontroller firmware, and transfer them when they are needed.
