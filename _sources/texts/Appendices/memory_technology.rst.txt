Flash memory
============

Flash memory is a type of non volatile memory. Flash memory has it's name from the requirement that one has to erase a whole block of memory if one or more bits of the block has to be changed from zero (0) to one (1). This is a so called `Flash` erase.

Initially (or straight after a `Flash` erase) all the bits of a flash memory block are one (1), and you only program the ones that have to be zero (0). As soon as a zero (0) bit has to return to the one (1) state however, you must perform `Flash` erase.

There is no physical limitation that forces us to use a full block erase, but the memory is designed in this way (the transistors are connected in such a way that this is the only possibility). The reason for doing this is that the erase cycle is a relative slow operation, and thus there is a speed gain in erasing many bits at once.

A Flash memory supporting single byte (or bit) erase is called a EEPROM. But in order to achieve this the circuit for each bit is more complex, and hence more expensive.

Each bit in a Flash memory consists of one transistor, specifically a floating gate MOSFET. The floating gate holds a negative charge when the bit is programmed, and neutral charge when it is not programmed. The negative charge prevents current from flowing through the transistor when a read voltage is applied, thus zero current is interpreted as a logic zero (0) :cite:`masuokaNewUltraHigh1987`.

Random access memory
=====================

Random access memory (RAM) refers to memory where individual bytes of data may be read and modified without affecting other parts of the memory.

Static RAM
-----------

Static RAM (SRAM) is a form of volatile memory. Each bit requires six transistors, and the read and write times are equal.



Dynamic RAM
-----------

Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a form of volatile memory. Each bit in a DRAM memory consists of one transistor and one capacitor.

The bits must be refreshed, i.e. the capacitor must be recharged at certain intervals if it is storing a one (1), to avoid loosing the information. The JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) standard states that the refresh rate should be less than 64 ms.

DRAM is normally very fast when compared to Flash memory, and has equal read and write speeds.

A hard diske drive uses magnetic storage to store data on a rotating platter. It has a moving read and write head.
