If the two signals have equal amplitude the displacement can be measured as the difference between the two. By subtracting one sine wave from the other, a new signal will emerge, with zero amplitude for zero phase displacement.

Discrete fourier transform (DFT)

If you know the frequency of the signal that you would like to measure, a single frequency DFT can be used to detect the phase difference.

For each of the signals the following equations will provide the phase relative to a reference:

.. math::

    x_i = \sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1} \cos(f \cdot t_n) \cdot x_n


.. math::

    x_q = \sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1} \sin(f \cdot t_n) \cdot x_n

.. math::

    \theta = \textnormal{arctan2}(x_i, x_q)


If both signals have the same reference, the phase difference can be computed by:

.. math::

    \varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_2

The reference for each signal will be the instant we start the sampling. This is not important however, since we are only looking at the difference.
